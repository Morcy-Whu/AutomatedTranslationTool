# AutomatedTranslationTool
It is a command-line tool that translates a given text from one language to another. The application will leverage a pre-trained neural network model for machine translation (e.g., a Transformer model from a library like Fairseq or OpenNMT). It involves a strong understanding of NLP and model-based software design.
